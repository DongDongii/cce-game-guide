# ðŸ”§ Deployment Troubleshooting Guide

## âœ… Issues Fixed

### 1. **Netlify Configuration Issue** âœ… FIXED
- **Problem**: netlify.toml had `publish = ".next"` but project exports to `out`
- **Solution**: Updated netlify.toml to use `publish = "out"` and removed Next.js plugin
- **File**: netlify.toml

### 2. **ZIP Structure Issue** âœ… FIXED  
- **Problem**: ZIP contained out/ directory instead of direct content
- **Solution**: Create ZIP from inside out directory: `cd out && zip -r ../output/output.zip .`
- **Script**: Automated in deploy.sh

### 3. **Missing Optimization Files** âœ… FIXED
- **Problem**: No _redirects and _headers files for Netlify optimization
- **Solution**: Added both files with proper routing and security headers
- **Files**: _redirects, _headers

## ðŸš€ Current Deployment Process

### Automated Deployment (Recommended)
```bash
cd seo-link-site
./deploy.sh
```
